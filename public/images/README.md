# Furniture Images

This directory contains furniture product images for the FurnitureAR app.

For a production application, you would populate this directory with high-quality images of your furniture products.

Currently, the app is using placeholder URLs, but you can replace them with actual image files named according to the pattern in the `products.ts` data file:

- sofa-1.jpg, sofa-2.jpg
- coffee-table-1.jpg, coffee-table-2.jpg
- dining-table-1.jpg, dining-table-2.jpg
- dining-chair-1.jpg, dining-chair-2.jpg
- bed-frame-1.jpg, bed-frame-2.jpg
- nightstand-1.jpg, nightstand-2.jpg

## 3D Models

For AR functionality, the app can use:
- GLB files for model-viewer web component
- USDZ files for iOS Quick Look

Sample 3D models are currently referenced from model-viewer.dev, but you should replace them with your own furniture models for production use.
